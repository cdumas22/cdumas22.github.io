              <h2>Bookmarks App</h2>
                    <p>
                    The idea for a bookmark app started when I began working at a new job. At this job many of the application I used were web based applications, but many of them would only work in IE8 (BLAH:(). Because of this I couldn't just bookmark pages because the bookmark was only in the browser that the bookmark was originally created in. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This lead me to starting this project. Much of the project was to learn new technology stacks and techniques, but in the end it has proven to be a great way for me to organize my bookmarks and have a central place were they could all live and be "browser agnostic". I have reworked this project using many different Javascript frameworks and backend enviroments, but the ones that have been fully implemented are below.         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Ultimately this project has been a learning experiment, and a way for me to learn new things; but it also helped solve a real world problem for me. 
                    </p>
                  <h3><a href="/Bookmarks">Backbone Bookmarks</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        This version of the bookmark app was build using Backbone, Require, Node, and Socket.IO. The pieces that make this version special is that it uses real-time updating using Sockets. It is also an example of various techniques with backbone.js. Within this project there are also chrome and safari plugins that can be installed in the browser to easily save bookmarks from anywhere.
                    </p>
                  <h3>Angular Bookmarks</h3>
                    <div>
                        <a class="button" href="http://github.com/cdumas22/AngualrBookmarks">GitHub</a>
                        <a class="button" href="/AngualrBookmarks">Project Page</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This version is created using AnjularJS. I created this off of the Angular-fullstack seed and have been impressed with how this seed has made the development of this app so easy. Currently I have a test version of this app hosted at <a href="http://cdumas22-b2.herokuapp.com">heroku</a>, so feel free to go over there and try it out.
                    </p>
              <h2>Show/Episode Manager</h2>
                  <p>The show/episode manager was a learning activity to see how to create parent child relationships in backboneJS. THis relationship would be that a Show can have many episodes, but that an episode cant exist without having a show. I wanted the routes and the ways they behaved to closely match restful practices. In the end I learned how to create these relationships which can be easily extended out into large scale applications.</p>
                  <h3><a href="/Show-Episode-Manager/">Show Episode Manager .Net Backbone</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        This was the first version of the manager. As such it doesn't look good, and is super basic. But because of this it is very easy to see how the relationship pattern works. It is build with .Net MVC as the backend webserver and uses Local Storage as the data store. I wanted the focus of this to be on the setup of backbone. 
                    </p>
                  <h3><a href="/ShowEspisodeManager/">Show Episode Manager Node</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        Once I was happy with the basic version of this manager I moved it to Node:) With this transition I added a few new features. Such as real-time editing with Socket.IO. This allows users to see changes in the app immediatly without having to refresh their browser. Also I finally added some prettier styles. And finally changed the data store to a mongo database. 
                    </p>
              <h2><a href="/Project-Euler/">Project Euler Solutions</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Project Euler has been a great place for me to sharpen my programming skills. Checkout my solutions and let me know what you think. Many of them are done in pure javascript with no library dependancies. Also many use threading to help optimize runtime and reduce ui lag.

          <h1>Plugins</h1>
              <p>
                Two of the big online video providors are <a href="http://www.ooyala.com">Ooyala</a> and <a href="http://brightcove.com">Brightcove</a>. I wanted a simple way to interact with these players without having to always use their api. These jQuery plugins are simple wrappers around their more robust APIs, but they make it more convienent to interact with these providers for jQuery developers. I tried to keep these plugins simple and uniform. 
              </p>
              <h2><a href="/jQuery-Ooyala-Plugin/">jQuery Ooyala Version 2 and Version 3 Plugins</a></h2>
                <p>
                    There are two plugins here. The first is the version 2 player plugin which is now pretty old. The second is the Ooyala V3 API plugin. I recomend using the V3 plugin. The idea behind using these plugins is to make it simple to embed one of these players into a webpage, and then be able to interact with it as well.
                </p>
              <h2><a href="/jQuery-Brightcove-Plugin/">jQuery Brightcove Plugin</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This plugin follows a very similar API to the Ooyala plugin, so if you know one, you know both:) Thus the magic of jQuery.
